# AnonBot

A Telegram Bot written in Python that allows users to communicate and vote on a task on Telegram anonymously to other users

# Purpose

Our group aims to accomplish the following in our solution:
1.	To create an anonymous platform where individuals could voice out their opinions without being influenced by othersâ€™ opinions, in the case of simple polls or surveys.
2.	To make a platform accessible and convenient for most individuals to use.
3.	To have a simple and effective way of displaying collated results.

To accomplish the factors above, we decided to create a telegram bot with the following functions: 
1.	Allows users to create sessions (i.e. survey, polls) containing one or more questions.
2.	Allows for respondents to remain anonymous when answering sessions.
3.	To prevent the results from being inaccurate, respondents will only be allowed to give one unique response to prevent multiple responses from the same individual.
4.	Allows sessions creators to retrieve the collated results easily.
5.	Host a MySQL Database on the cloud to allow uninterrupted storage and access of the sessions via the internet
